<p><b>The Tampa Bay Book Group</b> is a private group of book-lovers 
who meet the second Tuesday of every month to discuss a
book. The discussion is moderated by an HCC
professor who generously volunteers her time to the
group.  Sorry, we are not currently looking for new members.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

<h2>This Site June 2019 - Present </h2>
Well, it was fun working with Jekyll, but 
now that Amazon has changed its policies, I'm back to doing a 
static site by hand.  But it's really not bad - make liberal use
of server side includes and you can DRY your code up significantly. 
On the pages for 2020 and beyond, only the main content block is
maintained by hand; the rest is SSI.

<h2>This Site 2016 - June 2019 </h2>
<p>This website was built by <a href="http://www.thatsoftwareguy.com/">That Software Guy</a>, using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and the 
<a href="https://github.com/tokzk/jekyll-amazon">Jekyll::Amazon</a> gem.
<br /><br />
The source code for this site is available on Github.  You may use it as a template for <a href="https://github.com/scottcwilson/ort">building your book group website</a>.
<br /><br />
<b>Update June 2019</b>
Sadly, Amazon has changed their policies for access to the 
Advertising API, to the detriment of hobbyists like me. :( 
So the method above will only work if have an affiliate account 
that is making a significant amount of money. 
</p>

<h2>This Site - 2003 - 2016</h2>
<p>I used to maintain a site in static HTML with links to books created from 
the Associates Central linkbuilding page.  You can still 
<a href="http://thatsoftwareguy.com/old-ort/">see the old site</a>.</p>
